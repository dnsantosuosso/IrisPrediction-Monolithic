# IrisPrediction-Monolithic
A monolithic machine learning model utilizing Linear Regression to predict the petal length of Iris flowers given its sepal length and width, and its petal width.

The model is developed in an attempt to evaluate training and inference time in monolithic vs microservice architectures for Machine Learning models.

To run the project, install the required libraries and run the ```ml_pipeline.py```
