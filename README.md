# IrisPrediction-Monolithic
A monolithic machine learning model utilizing Linear Regression to predict the petal length of Iris flowers given its sepal length and width, and its petal width.

The model is developed in an attempt to evaluate training and inference time in monolithic vs microservice architectures for Machine Learning models.

To run the project, run the following commands:

1. Create a Virtual Environment: ```python -m venv env```
2. Install the required libraries: ```pip install pandas scikit-learn```
3. Run the ```ml_pipeline.py``` file.
